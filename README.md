This repository provides a collection of scripts and examples to simulate real-life optical effects caused by birefringence, a phenomenon where light experiences different refractive indices depending on its polarization and propagation direction.

The goal is to help students, researchers, and optics enthusiasts visualize and understand birefringent phenomena, and to model devices that rely on birefringence.

The project aims to:

- Offer easy-to-use simulation tools for birefringence-based effects.

- Provide didactic examples for teaching and learning polarization optics.
